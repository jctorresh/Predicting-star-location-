# Predicting-star-location- (Predicting the position of a star within the Milky Way Galaxy)
5GB of Gaia (space satellite) data were used to predict the radial position of a star from the center of the Milky Way. Calculations were handled using pyspark in AWS EC2. A Decision Tree Classifier was used from the Pyspark ML library with 2 predictor variables of surface temperature of the star (Teff) and the brightness measurement (Gmag ). We found that a wider population of stars are seen in the spiral arms of the galaxy, especially younger bluer stars.
